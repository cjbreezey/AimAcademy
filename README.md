## Background

Aim Academy is a game designed to help improve your mouse speed and accuracy. The game has three modes to test out and play; Timed, Survival, or God Mode. The rules are simple, use your mouse (or trackpad) to click objects that will randomly appear on screen. In timed mode, you have 1 minute to click as many object as you can before time runs out. In Survival mode, you have 3 lives to survive for as long as you can. You lose lives by having a target open and close without being clicked on. God mode is just like survival mode, except the targets are smaller, open and close faster, and appear at a more frequent rate.

This Game was built using only vanilla Javascript and HTML5 Canvas
